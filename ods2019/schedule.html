                                <div align="center"><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <span class="tooltiptext">In this talk, I will describe our work on aggregation of  charged polymers from both a coarse grained (CG) and all-atom (AA)  simulation perspective. The CG simulations on charged polymer systems  suggest that the backbone flexibility of the polymers plays a crucial  role in the aggregate conformational dynamics. The polymer flexibility introduces additional time scales into the aggregation dynamics in  case of flexible polymers and results in a more complex phase diagram  as a function of polymer charge density. While the CG simulations give  us insights into long time aggregation dynamics, they lack the detail  to probe specific effects of nature of counterions on the aggregation  dynamics of such charged polymers, which are ubiquitous in biology. We  then probe the early stage aggregation dynamics of biologically  relevant charged peptides in water via AA simulations. The simulations  reveal that the chemical identity and valency of cation in the added  salt play a crucial role in aggregate dynamics and morphology of the  peptides. The different ways in which the cations effectively  renormalize the charges of peptides are suggested to be the cause of  the differential effects of salts. These simulations underscore the  different roles of CG and AA simulations in probing the nature of  counterintuitive aggregation dynamics of similarly charged polymers.

                                <div align="center"><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <span class="tooltiptext">PEvaporating sessile droplets have been known to exhibit oscillations on the air-liquid interface. These are generally over millimeter scales. Using a novel approach, we are able to measure surface height changes of 500 nm amplitude using optical trapping of a set of microscopic particles at the interface, particularly when the vertical thickness of the droplet reduces to less than 50 ??�m. We find that at the later stages of the droplet evaporation, particularly when the convection currents become large, the top air-water interface starts to spontaneously oscillate vertically as a function of time in consistency with predictions. We also detect travelling wave trains moving in the azimuthal direction of the drop surface which are consistent with hydrothermal waves at a different combination of Reynolds, Prandtl and Evaporation numbers than previously observed. This is the first time that wave-trains have been observed in water, being extremely challenging to detect both interferometrically and with infra-red cameras. We also find that such waves apply a force parallel to the interface along the propagation direction. </span> </div>

                                <div align="center"><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <span class="tooltiptext">Understanding the role of frictional drag in diffusive transport is an important problem in the field of �living� or active turbulence. Using a generic continuum model that applies well to living systems, we investigate the role of Ekmann friction on the passive transport of Lagrangian tracers that go with the local flow. We find that the crossover from ballistic to diffusive regime happens at a time scale t c that attains a minimum at zero friction, meaning that both injection and dissipation of energy delay the relaxation of tracers. We explain this by proposing that t_c ~ l* /u rms , where l* is a dominant length scale extracted from energy spectrum peak, and u_rms is a velocity scale that sets the kinetic energy at steady state, both scales monotonically decrease with friction. Finally, we predict friction scaling laws for l*, u rms and the diffusion coefficient D ~ l* u rms /2, that are valid over a wide range of fluid friction. The findings of our report should apply to transport phenomena in dense bacterial suspensions, micro-tubule networks or even artificial swimmers, to name a few.

For all three classes, we find that the mean-squared displacement of a tagged particle scales asymptotically as $\sim \sqrt{t}$ and the particles form dynamic clusters at high activity. We show that this mean-squared displacement and the cluster size distribution are scaled functions of the model parameters, with same scaling exponents for the three classes. At high activity, we find that the velocity distribution function of the mobile clusters is non-Gaussian for run-and-tumble particles and active Brownian particles. Concomitantly, we observe that the two point density correlation function displays richer structures, including a second peak reminiscent of particle clustering induced by effective attractive interactions. </span> </div>

                                <div align="center"><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <span class="tooltiptext">Chemotaxis is a common mode of motility found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, by which a cell tries to follow a chemical gradient upstream or downstream. While prokaryotic bacteria like E.coli measure the chemical environment by performing a ``run and tumble" walk, eukaryotic cells ``polarise" when exposed to an external gradient by non-uniform localisation of intracellular signaling molecules. Generation of this internal polarity vector, or ``chemical compass", guides the motion of the cell by its coupling to actin polymerisation. Interestingly, in the absence of a chemo-attractant gradient, many eukaryotic cells have been found to move about randomly in a super-diffusive manner, characterised by long-range correlations in velocity. Using a rather generic model of cell polarisation, we argue that the origins of this super-diffusive motion might lie in the slow, algebraic  decay of auto-correlation of the cell polarity, which can be traced to spontaneous density fluctuations in an otherwise uniform chemo-attractant concentration field. </span> </div>
