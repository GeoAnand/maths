One rather gets electron and hole puddles due to this disorder, primarily arising from charge of the defects near the graphene-dielectric interface. The resultant potential inhomogeneity in graphene is also dependent on the screening of the defect potential by graphene carriers with the screening length strongly dependent on the carrier density. Thus the electron inhomogenieties are expected to evolve significantly even with fixed interface defects. In this talk I plan to discuss our recent studies on the electronic inhomogeneities in graphene using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). We measure local tunnel spectra and conductance maps as a function of back-gate voltage, which controls the carrier density. The local spectra, by way of tip-gating effect, give the variation in local Fermi energy, and the conductance maps explicitly probe the evolution of electronic inhomogeneity, with the back-gate voltage. Finally, both point to a role played by interface states in dictating the local graphene-potential in addition to the carrier density dependent screening length which, at least partially, dictates the length scale of the inhomogeneities.

Motivated by recent studies of quantum thermodynamics, we study if the QNEC restricts quenches in holographic many-body systems. We find that an increase in entropy and temperature is necessary but not sufficient to not violate QNEC in quenches that lead to transitions between BTZ geometries dual to thermal states carrying angular momentum. For an arbitrary initial thermal state, we can determine the lower and upper bounds on the temperature (entropy) increase that is necessary for a fixed increase in entropy (temperature) in order to satisfy the QNEC. Our study shows that the entanglement entropy thermalizes in time l/2 where l is the length of the entangling region with an exponent 3/2 for an arbitrary allowed transition generalizing earlier results. Furthermore we are able to determine the rate of initial quadratic growth exactly for any transition as a function of l and show that the QNEC bounds it.

Till date, observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) have successfully constrained several models of inflation by comparing their predictions with the observed primordial scalar power spectrum with amplitude $P_{zeta}(k) ~10^{-9}$ and a red-tilt. However, CMB surveys (e.g. Planck) can only probe ~ 10-15 e-folds of inflation near the CMB pivot scale $k=0.002 Mpc^{-1}$ and therefore fluctuations at smaller scales of inflation can be large enough to lead to large density contrast, which can collapse in the post-inflationary epochs to form primordial black holes (PBH). For PBH to contribute a considerable fraction of cold dark matter, the required amplitude of primordial scalar perturbations is quite large ($P_{zeta}(k) ~10^{-2}$ ) if they are formed in radiation epoch. In alternate cosmological histories, where additional epochs of arbitrary equation of state precede radiation epoch, the dynamics of PBH formation and relevant mass ranges can be different leading to requirement of lower amplitude of primordial power at smaller scales of infl ation. This alternate history can also modify the predictions for the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum, which can be probed by upcoming GW observations. Specifically, an early kination epoch, which is prevalent in quintessential inflation models, can lead to percent level abundance of PBH for a lower amplitude of $P_{zeta}(k)$ as compared to PBH formation in a standard radiation epoch.

This model is motivated by coupled oscillator systems with two populations and represents a discrete version of such systems. The splay phase state and its multiple copies are observed in this coupled map lattice evolving from a single splay phase initial condition spanning the entire system, for low values of sinusoidal nonlinearity i.e. where the system deviates slightly from the coupled shift map case. We show that the pure splay state is temporally chaotic, via linear stability analysis. We also show that depending on the parameters of the system the splay states bifurcate to splay chimera states consisting of a mixture of splay like structure and synchronised states, together with kinks in the phases of some of the maps and then to a stable globally synchronised states and are all found to be temporally chaotic in nature. We find that at specific values of the parameters of the system, a completely random initial condition evolves to chimera states, having a phase synchronised and a phase desynchronised group, where the space time variation of the phases of the maps shows structures similar to spatiotemporally intermittent regions. We obtain a phase diagram, identifying the region of the parameter space which supports such chimera states as well as other solutions such as globally phase synchronised states, two phase clustered states and fully desynchronised states. We estimate the basin stability of each kind of solution. The spatiotemporally intermittent chimera region is studied in further detail via numerical and analytic stability analysis, and the Lyapunov spectrum is calculated. This state is identified to be hyperchaotic as the two largest Lyapunov exponents are found to be positive. The average fraction of laminar/burst sites in the incoherent region of the chimera state is identified to be a crucial quantity as it settles to a unique value for each solution and is used to reproduce the phase diagram. An equivalent cellular automaton is obtained which shows space time behaviour similar to the coupled map lattice. The chimera regions show coexisting deterministic and probabilistic behaviour in the subgroup probabilities which show a transition to purely probabilistic behaviour at the boundaries of the region.

Rare-earth heavy-fermion systems such as CeCu6âˆ’xAux show a QPT between a fully Kondo-screened, paramagnetic Fermi-liquid phase and an antiferromagnetically ordered phase. When excited by a terahertz pulse, the heavy quasiparticles disintegrate and coherently recover on a picosecond timescale, characteristic of the Kondo coherence time or inverse Kondo temperature [2]. We use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to probe the Kondo quasiparticle spectral weight at such ultrafast timescales. Temperature-dependent examination of samples with different Au concentrations reveals that in the heavy-fermion (CeCu6) and the quantum-critical (CeCu5.9Au0.1) samples, the Kondo weight first increases upon lowering the temperature down to 30 K, followed by a decrease as we enter the quantum critical regime [2]. While in CeCu6 the Kondo weight drops by about 40%, in CeCu5.9Au0.1 it is completely destroyed below 5 K. The CeCu5Au sample, being deep in the antiferromagnetic phase, does not exhibit a visible Kondo weight at any temperature, despite the fact that low-temperature specific heat measurements reveal a sizeable Fermi liquid-like contribution.', 'Recent observations of large Fermi volume at temperatures much higher than the Kondo lattice temperature raised controversies on the validity of this long-known scale [3].This is because an enlarged Fermi volume is a hallmark of the existence of Kondo quasiparticles in heavy-fermion compounds.

The binding of ligand to a receptor triggers the internal signaling pathway and generates a \"polarity vector\", which guides the motion of the cell. The process as a whole consists of many stochastic events such as probabilistic receptor ligand binding and fluctuations in local ligand concentration which leads to fluctuations in the polarity vector. In case of multiple cells, coupling of individual polarity vectors occur due to the interaction of cells mediated by the ligand concentration field. Consequently this phenomenon may give rise to collective motion of cells. Recent studies reveal that even in the absence of external cues, the cells polarise spontaneously and move randomly. Motivated by these observations, we propose a stochastic model for spontaneous migration of a spherical cell which predict that the auto-correlation of the polarity vector decays algebraically at long times. Under some conditions, this may lead to super-diffusive motion of the cell, in agreement with the observations. In the long run, our investigation aims to characterise all the principal sources of extrinsic and intrinsic noise in the chemotaxis process, and to understand how it influences the motion of single cells, as well as interactions between them.

A study of the analyticity of F(s), leads to the study of an infinite sequence (the â€œfactorization -sequenceâ€) of numbers each of which is either +1 or -1.

It is of considerable interest to determine if there is a single canonical computation performed by such cortical columns in the transformation of sensory input to higher cognitive processes such as perception and memory. Dynamical models have been successfully used to simulate the functioning of different components of the brain in order to study the neural basis of behavior. In order to understand the dynamics of neurons and neuronal networks, several classes of single neuron models with differing degrees of complexity have been developed. The leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model is a simplified abstraction that captures essential characteristics of single neuron dynamics. Potjans and Diesmann (Cereb. Cortex, 2014) parameterized a four-layer, two cell type (i.e. excitatory and inhibitory) model of a cortical column with homogeneous populations of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and cell type dependent connection probabilities. To explore computations subserved by this model, we used a displacement integro-partial differential equation (DiPDE) population density model to characterize each neuronal population in the column. In the limit of large homogeneous populations, this reduces to a mean field model and provides a fast numerical method to solve equations describing the full probability density distribution of neuronal membrane potentials. It lends itself to quickly analyzing the mean response properties of population-scale firing rate dynamics. I will outline the development of the DiPDE population density model starting with the master equation for leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with shot noise input and compare it with analyses of neuronal population dynamics using the Fokker-Planck equation. I will describe how it can be used to explore the influence of different input weight distributions on the dynamics of neuronal populations. I will then show how we used this strategy to examine the input-output relationship of the Potjans and Diesmann cortical column model to understand its computational properties. When inputs are constrained to jointly and equally target excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we found a large linear regime where the effect of a multi-layer input signal can be reduced to a linear combination of component signals.

This talk will present exhaustive experimental results on electrical switching of Ge-Sb-Te, Ag, In-doped Sb2Te and In-Sb-Tebased PCM devices including ultrafast electrical switching dynamics, voltage-dependent transient characteristics in picosecond timescale using a custom-built advanced programmable electrical test setup [4-9]. Furthermore, a trajectory map for defining the ultimate speed of PCM devices will be discussed on the basis of field-dependent transient dynamics in picosecond timescale [6-9]. This map is developed based on a systematic understanding of the voltage-dependent, time-resolved transient characteristics using voltage pulses of various short pulse-widths (full width half maximum, FWHM) down to 1.5 ns. Our experimental results show that the delay time, td decreases exponentially for increasing the applied voltage, VA above the threshold voltage, VT. With sufficient over-voltage, the device switches remarkably fast at its VT,revealing an ideal â€˜zero-delay-timeâ€™. On the other hand, Ag,In doped Sb2Te device reveals a strikingly differentthreshold switching behavior at VT without delay (sub-50 ps).The switching speed is primarily governed by the rate of VT and it is independent of VA. These novel findings of unique switching behavior of Ag,In-doped Sb2Te and the trajectory map for enabling the ultimate speed of PCM devices would pave a way towards realizing â€˜universal memoryâ€™ for future computing.', '', '', '', 'None', 'Seminar Room', '3:00 PM', '4:00 PM', 'None', '', '[1] M.

Yet, the two phases are stable at room temperature and exhibit pronounced optical and electrical contrast. The ability of the glass to crystallize quickly at high temperature and yet to be extremely stable at low temperature has been linked to the pronounced fragility of the supercooled liquid phase of PCMs. These unique properties are exploited in rewritable optical devices (Blu-Ray Disc) and electronic non-volatile random access memories (PC-RAM), where heating is induced by laser irradiation and the Joule effect, respectively. Remarkably, the time and length scales relevant to state-of-the-art phase-change memory cells are almost within reach of first-principles methods based on density functional theory. Here we present ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of crystallization of two prototypical PCMs, namely Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ag,In-doped Sb2Te, as well as a recently discovered ultrafast PCM, Sc0.2Sb2Te3. It is shown that high-temperatures simulations of Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ag,In-doped Sb2Te yield crystal growth velocities in good agreement with experimental data. They indicate that fast crystal growth stems from the large diffusion constants and sticking coefficients and the presence of a sharp crystalline-liquid interface.

Examples range from window glass to complex fluids such as suspensions, emulsions, gels, polymers and granular materials. One often wonders what is glassy state. The answer lies at a very fundamental level. All systems which have relaxation times much larger than their typical molecular relaxation time are generally called as glassy systems. In this context, it is very important to know why the relaxation time is very high and what are the actual governing mechanisms behind the glassy state. By observation from outside a glassy material bears the resemblances of both a solid & a liquid. Purely from a mechanical point of view they are solid-like but from a structural point of view they are liquid-like i.e. they lack true long range order. In general, high viscous liquids show glassy state when they undergo rapid cooling. Once the system reaches glassy state, some concomitant properties arise spontaneously such as dynamic heterogeneity, cage effect and aging. While the dynamical properties of the system change drastically, the structural properties remain more or less the same as one approaches to Tg. Several theories are developed to explain the glass transition but none of them give satisfactory explanation for all the properties simultaneously. The phenomenon does not fall under the purview of conventional equilibrium & non-equilibrium statistical physics. It is not a thermodynamic phase transition in any sense but appears to be a transition from ergodic (liquid) to non-ergodic (solid) phase in space-time. While a lot of work has been done in the area of glass transition in equilibrium systems, very little is known for non-equilibrium (active) systems undergoing glass transition. Well known examples of such active systems include bacterial suspensions and self propelled granual media.

As most of our understanding of materials comes from studying the interaction of electromagnetic fields with matter, it is necessary to have a tool that can enable the fields to interact with the matter at nanoscale. Scanning Microwave Microscopy (SMM) or Near-field Microwave Microscopy (NFMM) is a novel and a new addition to the scanning probe microscopy technique and is related to the measurement of the materials response to microwave radiation on much lower length scales compared to the free space wavelength of the irradiated microwave wavelength. SMM integrates two well-known measurement tools, the scanning probe microscope (eg. AFM) for surface characterization andthe vector network analyser (VNA) for high-frequency signalmeasurements. The microscope allows for nanometre lateralresolution imaging, and the VNA provides high precisionimpedance and admittance measurements at broadband frequenciesfrom MHz to GHz, thus it enables nanoscale spatially resolved measurements of impedance variations at microwave frequencies.

This is due to their atomic size and spin-sensitive fluorescence that enables sensitive transduction of magnetic signals into optical signals. Magnetometry schemes employing single NV center and sophisticated pulsed protocols have shown the significant potential of NV based optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). We have extended the functionality of NV-based MR detection by demonstrating broadband spectroscopy of both ferromagnetic and paramagnetic spins in magnetic field orientations both parallel and transverse to the NV axis. Our spin-relaxation based modality uses an easily accessible continuous wave protocol where the NV spins themselves are non-resonant, and is compatible with using ensembles of NVs in a high NV density diamond to enhance sensitivity. We have performed spectroscopy of ferromagnetic dynamics in a wide variety of materials and for different ferromagnetic excitations such as the uniform mode FMR, high wavevector spinwave modes and domain-state related excitations. We have also measured the hyperfine spectrum of paramagnetic P1 spins within diamond. In the case of ferromagnetic dynamics, NV spin lifetime measurements indicate that ferromagnetic damping processes cause an enhancement of the NV relaxation rate, thus changing its spin state and fluorescence, and resulting in the observed optical detection of ferromagnetic dynamics. For the case of paramagnetic resonance detection, we propose a two-phonon Raman spinrelaxation process leading to the observed signal. I will discuss our experimental observations and the evolving theory to explain our data. Our experiments should provide new approaches to studying magnetization- and spin-relaxation processes, and enable more widespread adoption of NV-diamond based spectroscopy for studies at the micro to nanoscale.

The ICAL detector is optimised to detect charged current (CC) muon neutriuno and anti-neutrino events. These events have a muon track and hadron shower in the final state. Using a magnetic field, the charge of the muon can be determined and thus neutrino and anti-neutrino events can be identified separately. Muons have excellent energy and direction resolutions in ICAL. The only information about hadrons available in ICAL are the number and position of hits in the shower. Using this the energy and direction of hadrons can be reconstructed. Though have comparitively worse resolutions than muons, adding hadron energy along with muon momentum and direction as one of the final state observables improves the sensitivity to oscillation parameters. Performing the analysis in a wider range of observed muon energy, i.e, 0.5-25 GeV, and also imposing a constraint on the ration of muon-neutrino and anti-neutrino events improves the sensitivity to parameters especially to the 2-3 mixing angle.

In order to use these batteries for electric vehicle applications, high energy density and fast charging/discharging characteristics are essential. However, lower capacity of electrodes and severe capacity loss at higher current rates limits its application. The main reason for the decrease in the capacity at high current rates is the slow diffusion of lithium ions in the electrode materials. Understanding lithium diffusion is therefore very important for enhancing the performance of the battery. The structure, size and morphology play important role in controlling the diffusion coefficient. In oxide cathodes, lithium diffusion can happen in 1D or 2D or 3D pathways. In LiFePO4, where Li diffuses along [010] 1D channels, fast charging/discharging can be achieved by using nanowire morphology [1] or (010) facet nanosheets [2]. Therefore, controlling the size and shape will improve the Li diffusion coefficient. While LiFePO4 is a desirable cathode due to its higher capacity, it exhibit lower operating voltage compared to LiMnPO4. In this presentation, I will discuss how the Li diffusion gets altered in Li(Fe, Mn)PO4 nanowires.

Despite the strong constraints from Planck on primordial non-Gaussianities, a rather large set of inflationary models seems to remain consistent with the cosmological data, even as new models continue to be proposed. In such a situation, it seems imperative to explore viable alternatives to inflation. In this talk, after an introduction to inflation and the inflationary observables, I briefly discuss the performance of a handful of inflationary models against the cosmological data. Thereafter, I shall discuss as to how bouncing scenarios offer an alternative to inflation to overcome the horizon problem and also lead to scale invariant spectra. Specifically, I shall describe our recent work on a matter bounce scenario that leads to a viable tensor-to-scalar ratio and small tensor non-Gaussianities. I shall conclude by highlighting the typical theoretical challenges faced in constructing well motivated bouncing models that are also consistent with the observations.', '', '', '', 'None', 'Seminar Room', '4:00 PM', '5:00 PM', 'None', '', '', '', '', '1', 'admin@mail.com', '2022-02-21 11:27:28'),

We have studied electrical and magnetotransport on PLD (pulsed laser deposition) grown pure and doped ZnO thin films.

With recent developments in the field of cavity optomechanics -- wherein mechanical oscillators are strongly coupled to electromagnetic cavities -- it has become possible to experimentally address these challenges. Our group at EPFL has pioneered some of these developments with a view towards studying the limits imposed by quantum mechanics on the ability to measure and control nanomechanical oscillators. Using a cryogenic cavity-enhanced interferometer, we have recently demonstrated the ability to resolve the motion of a glass nanostring with an imprecision 40 dB smaller than its zero-point motion. The resulting back-action of the measurement is commensurate with the prediction of the uncertainty principle, resulting in an imprecision-back-action product of 5 hbar/2. The continuous record of this highly efficient measurement is used in a feedback loop to cool the oscillator close to its ground state, thereby cancelling measurement back-action -- an example of quantum feedback.

However, other processes also occur concurrently such as cortical flow, membrane addition at the furrow, and the inward growth of new cell wall (septum) in the wake of the constricting ring in cell-walled organisms such as fission yeast. Thus, the ultimate goal is a quantitative model of ring constriction coupled with these processes. Here I will describe our progress towards this goal using experimental measurements of cytokinetic ring tension and mathematical modeling To measure ring tension, we used a novel method that combines membrane tension measurements with images of the cytokinetic furrow in live fission yeast protoplasts, cells that lack a cell wall. We measured a ring tension of ~400 pN. We used this in a mathematical model of septum cell wall growth, mediated by the cell wall growing beta-glucan synthases (Bgs) which we hypothesized were mechanosensitive (Thiyagarajan et al., 2015). The stochastic growth produced by Bgs resulted in rough edges with growth defects. In simulations, ring tension modulated Bgs growth rates in a curvature-dependent fashion, suppressing defects and roughness so septum edges were nearly circular. Simulated edges had low roughnesses (~5%) and a roughness exponent ~0.5, consistent with septum edges we measured in live cells. Our model revealed a mechanosensitivity ~15% per pN per Bgs complex. Thus, ring tension regulates septum growth to ensure the septum closes as a shrinking circle (not a slit) and daughter cells are properly sealed by new cell wall.

However, the utility of the EBG bandgap often comes at the expense of the typically large EBG unit cells that limits their inclusion in highly space-constrained scenarios, e.g. within microstrip devices and antennas. On the other hand, many MTMs, such as the transmission-line (TL) MTM, afford very small unit cells through reactive loading but arenâ€™t specifically designed to support controllable bandgap behaviour. A new technology known as the metamaterial-based electromagnetic bandgap structure (MTM-EBG) has proven successful in achieving strong and predictable bandgaps in compact microstrip structures. The bandgap behaviour is achieved in a compact fashion by embedding a multiconductor TL within the microstrip, and then using TL MTM-based reactive loading concepts to force the contradirectional coupling of supported TL modes. Importantly, the MTM-EBG is uniplanar, without vias, and can be fully printed, making it particularly useful for simple and cost-effective integration into microstrip antennas and feed networks. The utility of the MTM-EBG is further established by the fact that its dispersion properties may be rigorously and accurately designed using multiconductor TL theory, eliminating ad-hoc approaches and minimizing arbitrary tuning. This talk will review the many examples of MTM-EBG usage in antennas and antenna systems that have been demonstrated in the recent literature.

In disordered optical and electron systems Anderson localization originates from phase coherent scattering in the systems, causing the wavefunctions in the media to transform from extended waves to waves confined to be bound in a finite region of space. The specific form of the phase coherent scattering has been observed in a variety of effects found in classical and quantum physics. In this regard, localization is present in wave phenomena and is observed in both classical and quantum physics. For infinite systems with localized wavefunctions at zero temperature, there is no transport. However, upon the introduction of temperature fluctuations into the medium conductivity through hopping between localized states occurs. In materials which are periodic on average the interaction of periodicity and random disorder both affect the nature of localization and the system wavefunctions. This interaction shows up in the size of the region over which the wavefunctions are bound and its dependence on periodicity and disorder. In nonlinear media the interaction of nonlinearity with the disorder gives rise to new forms of localization. A variety of interesting physical effects due to localization are observed in electronic and optical systems. Anderson Localization shows up in electronic media as a metal-insulator transition and in optical media in retro-reflectance phenomena.

Such a collection of trapped ions exchange vibrational quanta through the Coulomb interaction. In this talk, we will investigate alternative methods for thermally induced nonclassicality generation in two very different contexts. First, in the harmonic approximation, the linear interaction can be shown to be enharmonically modulated by an elementary coupling to the internal two-level structure of the ions. Driven by thermal energy in the passively coupled oscillators, the nonlinear interaction autonomously and unconditionally generates entanglement between the mechanical modes of the ions. In addition, we demonstrate multiqubit enhancement of such thermally induced entanglement. In the second part of the talk, we will go beyond the harmonic approximation which leads to the realization of nonlinear Hamiltonians, such as both the degenerate and nondegenerate parametric oscillator Hamiltonians. Stimulated by small thermal energy, the strong degenerate trilinear coupling generates large amounts of nonclassicality which is detectable by more than 3~dB of distillable quadrature squeezing, in contrast to the nondegenerate trilinear coupling. Substantial entanglement can be generated in tandem with the nonclassicality generation via linear coupling to a third mode, achieving the entanglement potential of nonclassical states. Such entanglement, although not captured by the covariance matrix, grows with the mean number of split thermal quanta. We extend our investigation to higher-order degenerate quanta splitting processes to demonstrate that this non-Gaussian entanglement is already common for strongly nonlinear systems at the low-energy thermal level.', '', '', '', 'None', 'S N Bose Hall (HSB 210)', '3:00 PM', '4:00 PM', '', 'None', '', '', '', '1', 'admin@mail.com', '2022-11-03 03:18:30'),

Many magnetic materials have low-temperature states in which the atomic magnetic moments are ordered, like atoms in a crystal. Geometrical frustration is interesting as a way of making something different happen. Frustrated magnets have interactions that compete with each other, and fluctuate between many different states even at low temperature. In this sense they provide an analogue for magnetic systems of the liquid phase of ordinary matter. Spin liquids, however, turn out to be much more interesting in important ways than ordinary liquids: in their low-energy states the microscopic magnetic moments are dissolved by fluctuations and re-form as new degrees of freedom, often involving emergent gauge fields and fractionalised quasiparticles. I aim to present a simple overview of ideas in this field and to summarise some recent work on the dynamics of a remarkably simple, exactly solvable model -- the Kitaev honeycomb model -- that has a spin liquid ground state.', '', 'John Chalker was awarded a BA in Theoretical Physics from the University of Cambridge and a DPhil from the University of Oxford, where his advisor was Gillian Gehring.

It has been described as the oldest outstanding problem that has had a long and difficult history. Progress has been slow, although efforts were multi-pronged. On one hand there is Yukawas theory that attempts to describe the physics of the nuclei using protons and neutrons as the degrees of freedom via meson exchanges, leading to the field of nuclear phenomenology. On the other hand, it has been well established that Quantum Chromodynamics is the correct theory of strong interaction. But QCD becomes non-perturbative at low-energies and hence nuclear structure calculations using quarks and gluon degrees of freedom become impossible.\r\nIn 1990, Steven Weinberg established the fundamental link between QCD and nuclear phenomenology via Effective Field theories. From a modern point of view, nuclei are the asymptotic bound states of quarks and gluons and are described by the low-energy degrees of freedom, that is, nucleons interacting via pion exchanges. The crucial connection between QCD and nuclear phenomenology comes through the low-energy symmetries of QCD, that is, the spontaneously broken approximate chiral symmetry, resulting in the identification of the pions as the pseudo-Goldstone bosons. The crux of the EFT approach is the decoupling of the long and short distance physics.\r\nOne can use similar ideas in the phenomenological sector and decouple the high and low-degrees of freedom via Unitary transformations of the Hamiltonian.

Though the conventional thin film methods such as the chemical vapor deposition (CVD), pulse vapor deposition (PLD) etc possess inherent advantages, they also pose several short comings such as complex instrumentation, high cost, and limitations in stabilizing certain phases. Yet another very interesting challenge in materials science comes from nanoscopic inhomogeneities. Limitations to material properties and performance are not imposed merely by the selection rules. For instance though quantum mechanics poses no hindrance to room temperature Tc in the cuprate superconductors, nanoscopic inhomogeneities lead to competing orders and pull down the Tc to liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT). Thus cuprate superconductors can rightly be called as \'failed room temperature superconductors\'.\r\nSolutions to these problems can be sought from electrochemistry.

It has been shown that material quality no longer constrains performance in the best performing halide perovskite solar cells, rather it is inefficiencies in the management of photons that are the largest source of losses in Jsc and Voc due to poor harvesting of photons near the semiconductor band-edge, non-radiative carrier recombination losses limiting the match of the solar cell to a black body radiator at the same temperature, poorly optimized angular distribution of emission due to radiative recombination of carriers, and changes in the entropy of photons.

High performance photocatalysts need to make optimal use of incident light to drive chemical reactions.

When pi-conjugated molecules or quantum dots are introduced into a photonic crystal whose absorption profile matches the photonic stop band, very strong absorption can result in such defect-doped photonic crystals, which is useful for photocatalysis.

For modeling the mass-dependence of observables, I apply a novel Bayesian method to account for sample selection biases, measurement uncertainties, the shape of the cluster mass function, and scatter in the true mass-observable scaling relations. Importantly, I allow for a possible covariance between the X-ray luminosity and the SZ effect at fixed mass, which had been neglected in similar analyses in the past.

An interesting outcome that might not be entirely intuitive, however, is that the wavefront of the superposition of two beams with unequal amplitudes will exhibit a wavy behavior. The first successful attempt to observe ‘backflow’ was made recently in an assembly of optical fields [1], by synthesizing their wavefront in a complex manner. In our work [2], we experimentally observe, by measuring the transverse local wave-vectors using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor [3], that the phenomenon of backflow arises naturally from the interference of two unequal beams. This phenomenon effectively occurs when the local momentum of a state is not present in its global Fourier spectrum, an outcome also referred to as super (sub) oscillations. Until recently, this subject was largely a fundamental phenomenon under study. However, there has been a newfound interest in its potential applications in super-resolution imaging [4] and in manipulating a particle’s path. Our study corroborates the theoretical observation [5,6] that backflow is not necessarily the purely quantum phenomenon that it is often thought to be but arises from wave interference. With our demonstration, the effect has been made accessible and easy to achieve in the lab , thus opening pathways for future applications.

Examining the \"turbulences\" (eddies) in the river Arno of Florence,\r\nhe found that the amplitude of the turbulence was decreasing very slowly\r\nin time, until it would come to rest (within the surrounding river). In\r\nspite of Leonardo\'s strong interest in mathematics, at that time, it\r\nconsisted basically of geometry and simple polynomial equations. There\r\nwere no tools available to describe the very slow temporal relaxation of\r\nturbulence. This topic would remain dormant for about 430 years, until in\r\n1938 Karman, triggered by Taylor, established that the mean energy of the\r\nturbulence should decrease very slowly, indeed like an inverse power of\r\nthe time elapsed. Three years later, Kolmogorov himself found another\r\ninverse power\r\n(10/7) of the time elapsed. This, likewise was wrong, because he was\r\nassuming a certain invariance property (Loitsiansky , proved later\r\nwrong by Proudman and Reid). The main change in the last few decades is\r\nthat fully developed turbulence is definitely not self-similar, not only\r\nis it fractal, but it can have infinitely many fractal scalings\r\n(multifractality), as proposed by Parisi and Frisch in the eighties.\r\nFurthermore, multifractality can manifest itself either at small scales or\r\nat large scales. The latter might change the law of energy decay. Not\r\nenough is understood for the 3D Euler equations, but large-scale\r\nmultifractality for the Burgers is an interesting possibility, which is\r\nbeing explored by Frisch, Khanin, Pandit and Roy.

In recent times, with the development of nanotechnologies, the functionalities of conventional materials have advanced further and many novel applications   are now being explored. Such advanced materials, both in the conventional (bulk) and nano form, are important in several fields such as energy conversion (solar cells) and storage (batteries), microelectronic devices, multiferroic materials, bio-compatible coatings and implants, high strength materials and functional materials for sensors, membranes etc. This interdisciplinary Dual Degree (ID-DD) program aims at equipping the students with an understanding of the fundamental science behind advanced materials and also training them with the practical tools and techniques of fabrication (materials and devices). The Department of Physics, IIT Madras is coordinating this new program with the active participation of several other departments.', 'The IDDD programme in Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology designed with inputs from Engineering and Science disciplines. Departments currently offering courses towards this program are Applied Mechanics, Chemical, Chemistry, Electrical, Materials and Metallurgy, Physics. It is typically coordinated by one of these departments. Currently it is coordinated by the Department of Physics.', 'B.Tech students (all branches) of IIT Madras can opt for this program. The minimum eligibility criteria prescribed by the senate is that the student should have a minimum of 8 CGPA at the end of 5 th semester.', 'The Curriculum is designed with the understanding that the modern field of Advanced materials and Nanotechnology is based on the exchange of ideas between sciences and Engineering branches. <br>\r\nThe list of courses to be offered for students opting for DD in Advanced Materials and Nano Technology will have both core courses and electives. The students are allowed to choose four electives out of a total of 33 electives cutting across different disciplines. There will be four core courses that include a course on the Science and Technology of Solid State, two courses on nanomaterials and nanotechnology and a Laboratory course aimed at giving hands-on experience on Advanced materials and nano systems (36 credits of DD core course).<br />\r\nThose students who opt for the Dual Degree program will do the courses from their 7th Semester as prescribed below.', '', 'advanced_materials_and_nano_tech_curriculum.pdf', 'Department-Electives-new.pdf', '', '', '', '1', '3', '2022-06-22 06:52:36'),

Examples of complex systems can be diverse including, but not limited to, coupled neurons in the brain, spatially distributed interacting systems like the movement of tectonic plates in a planet, transportation network of a large metropolitan, online social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and the ocean-atmosphere coupling in the climate system. Predicting phenomena such as brain epilepsy, climate change and global warming, pandemics, failure of networks involving distributed computing, power or transportation, species extinction in biological ecosystems, earthquakes, bio-mimetic flows and fluid-structure interactions, viral social media posts, forecasting financial crisis, crowd management etc.; these require a deeper understanding of the overall dynamics of the associated multi-physics systems and a complex system approach to investigate it. Mathematical models of such systems are complex, are typically nonlinear and stochastic and involve modeling the coupling between the interacting individual systems. The traditional reductionist approach that builds an understanding of the individual components, is not suitable for analyzing the collective behaviour. This necessitates the development of new techniques and approaches that have come to be known collectively as complex systems approach.<br /><br />\r\nThis is a rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field that enables bridging the gap between fundamental knowledge and mathematical models with the empirical observations as well as copious dataset available on account of the advent of new technological innovations that were unthinkable even a few years ago. The identification, organization and analysis of such data need to draw on the methods of data mining, artificial intelligence, neural nets and deep learning algorithms. The efficient use of this data in conjunction with the methods of probabilistic and causal analysis can lead to significant improvements in the construction of realistic models, as well as in the prediction of catastrophic events such as earthquakes, fluid structure interaction problems, power grid collapses, stock market collapses, and pandemics of disease that can occur in such systems.<br /><br />\r\nThe impact of these technical skills has the potential to directly address global challenges arising from human-nature interactions such as, climate change, pandemics, mass migration and ecological disorders, together with the possibility of harnessing technology towards growth and the improvement of life and the environment.', 'The aim of the proposed program is to introduce students to new techniques and tools for mathematical modelling and analysis of complex dynamical systems and to investigate some of the challenging dynamical problems in climate science, neuroscience, biological systems, Multiphysics systems and active flows, that are the focus of current research worldwide. In addition to enhancing the fundamental understanding of the universal features, which contribute to similar phenomena that occur across a diversity of systems, the effort could also translate into delivering technology which is useful in industrial and societal contexts.', 'B.Tech students (all branches) of IIT Madras can opt for this program. The minimum eligibility criteria prescribed by the senate is that the student should have a minimum of 8 CGPA at the end of 5 th semester.', 'The primary objectives are to train students\r\n\r\nâ— In building network based mathematical models for large scale complex dynamical systems using observational data and use the new theories of complex networks for analysis\r\nâ— In theories of nonlinear dynamical systems that enables analysis of complex systems which are inherently nonlinear\r\nâ— In high performance computing skills and data analysis\r\n\r\nTo achieve these objectives, the course curriculum consists of three compulsory core courses\r\n\r\n(a) one from Complex Networks basket that introduces students to complex networks analysis\r\n(b) one from Nonlinear Dynamics basket that exposes students on this subject\r\n(c) one from a select set of Mathematics and Numerical Techniques courses. The courses have been selected to ensure that students can cater to be trained in appropriate skill sets that will be more suitable for their project.\r\n\r\nThe electives are to be selected from a basket of carefully curated courses that encompass the interdisciplinary nature of the program. The electives can be selected from courses on Data Science, High performance computing, as well as a mix of elective courses applicable to diverse engineering fields, which will enable the students to combine the traditional skills with the new approaches of complex dynamical systems.', '', 'complex_systems_and_dynamics_curriculum.pdf', 'Department-Electives-new.pdf', '', '', '', '1', '3', '2022-06-22 07:09:42'),

Quantum science and technologies have taken giant strides over the last decade, with companies like IBM, Google and Honeywell showcasing quantum devices with 10-100s of quantum bits (qubits). Keeping in mind the widespread need for a quantum-skilled workforce, across academia and industry, IIT Madras introduced the interdisciplinary dual-degree program on quantum science and technologies (QuST) in 2020.', 'The core courses of the IDDD QuST programme are offered by faculty from the departments of Physics and Electrical Engineering., while the suggested elective courses are spread out across Physics, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the program is to provide students with fundamental knowledge and skills in the domain of Quantum Science and Technology (QuST). Key learning outcomes include,\r\n\r\n1. Basic understanding of theoretical aspects of quantum bits, quantum gates, circuits and algorithms.\r\n2. Hardware skills: understanding the physical and technical aspects of building quantum devices, across different quantum computing architectures.\r\n3. Software skills: implementing quantum algorithms and protocols on existing quantum device platforms.\r\n4. Application of quantum information theory to fundamental physics questions in areas like many-body physics and cosmology.', 'B.Tech students (all branches) of IIT Madras can opt for this program.

In particular we study superfluidity which is a crucial input for the thermal evolution of the stars and the correct explanation of the glitches. A closely related system that we study is a gas of ultra cold fermions which is backed by a plethora of experiments. In such systems, the scattering length can be tuned via Feshbach resonances to the unitary limit which ressembles the nuclear system which naturally has a large scattering length.
